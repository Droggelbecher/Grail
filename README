What is Grail?
==============

Grail aims to be a complete engine for developing old school point-and-click
2D adventure games. It aims to be screen platform- and resolution independant
and easy to use and to extend.

Compiling
=========

Under Linux
-----------

First make sure you have all the development libraries listed in
doc/dependencies.txt installed.

Change your working directory to the directory that contains this README file
and type:

cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"
make

Obviously you need cmake for this to work. For library dependencies refer to
doc/dependencies.txt

The code should compile and run under Windows as well though due to the lack
of a package manager its lots more work to collect all the dependencies,
install a compiler and so on. When the code is mature enough for release we
will publish ready-to-run binary files for Windows.


Running
=======

The demo application is located in the demo/ folder.
Change your working directory to the directory that contains the demo folder
and type (after compiling):

runtime/grail_runtime demo/

Don't expect too much yet, its all still WIP.
